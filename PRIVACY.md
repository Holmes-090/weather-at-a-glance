# Privacy Policy üîí

Last updated: January 2025

## Overview

This Weather App is designed with privacy as a fundamental principle. We believe your location data should remain private and under your control.

## üìç Location Data

### What We Access
- **Device Location**: We request access to your device's location services to provide weather data for your current area
- **City/Region**: We convert coordinates to readable city names for display purposes

### How We Use Location Data
- **Weather Forecasts**: Your coordinates are sent only to weather API providers to fetch relevant weather data
- **City Display**: Location is converted to a city name for a better user experience
- **Local Storage**: Your location preference is saved locally on your device for convenience

### What We DON'T Do
- ‚ùå **No Location Tracking**: We don't track your movements or location history
- ‚ùå **No Location Sharing**: Your location is never shared with third parties except weather services
- ‚ùå **No Background Tracking**: Location is only accessed when you use the app
- ‚ùå **No Location Analytics**: We don't analyze location patterns or behavior

## üõ°Ô∏è Data Collection

### Information We DON'T Collect
- Personal information (name, email, phone number)
- User accounts or authentication data
- Device identifiers for tracking
- Usage analytics or behavior data
- Location history or movement patterns
- Any personally identifiable information (PII)

### Information Stored Locally
The following data is stored only on your device:
- **Selected Location**: Your chosen city/coordinates for weather display

- **App Settings**: UI preferences and configurations

This local data:
- Never leaves your device

### Important Notes

## üîê Data Security

### Technical Safeguards
- **HTTPS Only**: All API communications use encrypted connections
- **No Server Storage**: We don't operate servers that store user data
- **Local Encryption**: Device storage uses platform-standard encryption
- **Minimal Permissions**: App requests only essential permissions

### Code Transparency

## üì± Permissions

### Location Permission
